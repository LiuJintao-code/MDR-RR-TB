Research Background:  
For patients with multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) undergoing long-term treatment, early prediction of treatment outcomes is of critical importance. This not only helps improve patients' clinical outcomes but also plays a crucial role in effectively controlling the spread of this highly contagious and lethal disease.
Research Objectives  
This study uses demographic and clinical data to establish logistic regression and multiple machine learning models to predict the efficacy of MDR/RR-TB treatment at 2 and 6 months. By comparing the models, the best predictive model will be selected. The research objective is to advance model application, improve control strategies, and increase the cure rate of MDR/RR-TB.
